1. run plot ch4 to check your observations and sampling area timestamps and lat lond
2. run TIE observations to obtain TIE for your observational data
3. run lat_lon_to_xy to convert observational data to ADMS grid (source at 0,0) 
4. run create_adms_met to create a met file to use in the adms model runs
5. run ADMS moedel and get yourfile.levels.gst file
6. run TIE adms on yourfile.levels.gst file
7. calculate emission flux = (aircraft TIE * ADMS flux imput) / adms TIE
