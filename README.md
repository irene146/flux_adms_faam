# README
This repository contains scripts and sample data for calculating fluxes using the ADMS dispersion model and aircraft measurements.


## Repository Structure

- `faam_data/`: Contains scirp to obtail aircraft data  form the FAAM Airborne Laboratory for the flux calculations.
- `flux_estimation_adms/`: Contains Python scripts for calculating fluxes.
- `sample_data/`: Example datasets to test the provided scripts.
- `adms/`: Tools for quickplot of results and modifying adms input files (.apl)
